## Contents

* Will be replaced with the ToC
{:toc}

Resources are project sections that define a `prepare` operation. They
can be used to perform miscellaneous operations for a project.

For an example of a resource, see the `samples` resource defined in the
{% ref mnist-example-guild %}.

## Resource attributes

### prepare

Resources are *prepared* and so use a `prepare` command spec.
